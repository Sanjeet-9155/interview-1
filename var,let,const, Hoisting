 var, let, const
------------------
1)variable can be re-decled & update. this is a global scope variable
  (Re-assign, kahi bhi access kar sakte)
2)let Variable cannot be re-declaed but can be update .it is block scope varible.
  (Re-assign, Access sirf kud ke bolck ke ander)
3)cont variavle cannot be re-decaled or update this is a block scope variable.
   (Re-assign nhi kar sakte, Access sirf khud ke block ke ander)


let	         
The scope of a let variable is block scope
It can be updated but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
It can be declared without initialization.
These variables are hoisted but stay in the temporal dead zone untill the initialization.
It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.

Const 
The scope of a const variable is block scope.
It can neither be updated or re-declared in any scope.
It cannot be declared without initialization.
These variables are hoisted but stays in the temporal dead zone until the initialization.
It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.

HOistING?
---------
histing is the deafault behaivoius whrersas all the function and variiable 
declarartions are moved on the top.
means variables declared of the undefined & 
function declared of the function..



// var age = 22;

// var age1 = "sanjeet"
// age1 = 'sdh'

// console.log(age)
// console.log(age1)
// console.log(age)
// var age = 23;
// // if(true){
// //     var age = 23;
// // }

// console.log(age)
//console.log(age)
// let age = 56
// console.log(age)
if(true){
    let age = 23;
    let age1 = 45
    console.log(age)
    console.log(age1)
}

//console.log(age)

// const age = 23;//value re-assign nhi ho sakti
// age = 'svdhgh'

// console.log(age);
