(Spread)
1. Represented by three dots (...), the spread 
operator is used to expand elements of an 
iterable (like an array or string) into 
individual elements.
2. Useful for copying arrays and objects without 
modifying the original.
3. Ensures immutability in functions where 
modification of inputs is not desired.

(Rest)
• Used to collect the remaining 
elements of an array after 
extracting some elements.
• Used to collect the remaining 
properties of an object after 
extracting some properties.
