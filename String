1. Strings hold textual data, anything from a 
  single character to paragraph.
2. Strings can be defined using single quotes ' 
  ', double quotes " ", or backticks ` `. 
   Backticks allow for template literals, 
   which can include variables.
3. You can combine (concatenate) strings 
   using the + operator. For example, "Hello" 
   + " World" will produce "Hello World".
