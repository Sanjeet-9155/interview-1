1. Code that runs multiple times based on 
   a condition.
start----> condition--->jaise condition hoga ---> true loop ke under ghumta rahega 
jab condtion false stop hoga.

2. Loops also alter the flow of execution, 
   similar to functions.
   • Functions: Reusable blocks of code.
   • Loops: Repeated execution of code.
3. Loops automate repetitive tasks.
4. Types of Loops: for, while, do-while.
5. Iterations: Number of times the loop 
   runs.


 While Loop
-----------
1. Iterations: Number of times the loop runs.
2. Used for non-standard conditions.
3. Repeating a block of code while a condition is true.
4. Remember: Always include an update to avoid infinite 
             loops.

while (condition) {
    // body of loop
}

// initialize variable i
let i = 1;

// loop runs until i is less than 4
while (i < 4) {
    console.log(i);
    i += 1;
}

for loop
---------
1. Standard loop for running code multiple times.
2. Generally preferred for counting iterations.

for (initialization; condition; afterthought)
  statement
