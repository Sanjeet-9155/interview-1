• The Fetch API provides a modern way to make HTTP 
requests in JavaScript.
• It is a promise-based API, making it easier to handle
asynchronous requests

Async / Await
1. Syntax Sugar for Promises: async/await is built on top of promises, providing a 
cleaner and more readable way to work with asynchronous code.
2. Defining Async Functions: An async function is declared using the async
keyword before the function definition. This function always returns a promise.
3. The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until a 
promise is resolved. It can only be used inside an async function.

(Handling Exceptions)
Errors in async functions can be handled using try...catch blocks, 
making error management straightforward and consistent with 
synchronous code.
