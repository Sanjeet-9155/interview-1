 Both are Comparison Operators
the different bwteen both operators 
is that == is used to Checks value equality.
=== is used to Checks value and type equality
•Equality
• == Checks value equality.
• === Checks value and type equality.

•Inequality
• != Checks value inequality.
• !== Checks value and type inequality.

•Relational
• > Greater than.
• < Less than.
• >= Greater than or equal to.
• <= Less than or equal to.

Order of comparison operators is less than arithmetic operator

If the condition is true, the expression after the logical && operator will be the output.
If the condition is false, React ignores and skips the expression.
